            <h2>The Evolution of Ethics in Malaysia</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The journey of Malaysian ethics is best understood by examining three pivotal historical eras that have shaped its unique character. Each period introduced different values and norms, contributing to the complex ethical landscape of modern Malaysia.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Pre-Colonial Era: The Foundation of Adab and Adat</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">The ethical framework in this era was fundamentally based on the concepts of **'Adab'** (good manners and proper conduct) and **'Adat'** (customs and traditions). These principles were not merely social guidelines but formed the backbone of the value system that governed traditional society, its leadership, and daily life. They emphasized respect, community harmony, and adherence to established social norms.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Colonial Era: Western Influence</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">The arrival of European colonizers introduced and systematically implemented Western concepts such as **'Etika'** (Ethics), **'Etos'** (Ethos), and **'Etiket'** (Etiquette). This brought about new standards of behavior, particularly in formal settings like government administration, legal systems, formal attire, and official speech. These new norms often coexisted with, and sometimes challenged, the traditional 'Adab' and 'Adat'.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Post-Colonial Era: A Contemporary Identity</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Contemporary Malaysian ethics represent a unique and dynamic blend of traditional values and modern principles. It is a synthesis of the pre-colonial 'Adab' and 'Adat' with the 'Etika' and 'Etiket' introduced during the colonial period. This fusion forms the distinct and multifaceted identity of modern Malaysian society, reflecting a continuous negotiation between its historical roots and its place in the globalized world.</p>

            <h2>Sociological Analysis Framework</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">To understand Malaysian ethics on a deeper level, we can use the 'Sociological Imagination' framework, developed by sociologist C. Wright Mills. This approach connects individual experiences to broader societal forces through three interrelated components: History, Social Structure, and Biography.</p>
